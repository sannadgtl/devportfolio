### Reflection  

**Custom CSS** - Occasionally, it was difficult to find the correct Bootstrap class that I needed to target for custom CSS.  
**Grid Section** - Recreating the grid section was the most challenging part of this project. I kept encountering a persistent extra white space on the right-hand side of the page whilst coding the grid, as well as needing to figure out how to switch the order of images on screens below the md breakpoint for a better layout flow.
