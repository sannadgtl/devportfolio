### Features to Add in Future Iterations

**Splash Screen** - An initial screen displaying the game instructions.  
**Randomised lyrics** - Currently, the lyrics appear in the order they are listed in the array. Implementing randomisation would enhance the gameplay.  
**Timer** - Adding a timer to introduce an extra challenge.  
**Incorrect Answers** - A section displayed at the end of the game to show which questions the user got wrong.
